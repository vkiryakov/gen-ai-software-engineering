## 📤 How to Submit Your Homework

### 1️⃣ Create a Branch for Each Assignment

```bash
# For homework 1
git checkout -b homework-1-submission

# Work on your assignment...

git add .
git commit -m "Complete homework 1"
git push origin homework-1-submission
```

### 2️⃣ Create a Pull Request

> **Pull request quality:** Do not submit a bare or one-line PR. Prepare a **detailed pull request** with a full description of what you implemented, how you used AI, how reviewers can run and verify your work, and **screenshots** (or other demos) where the homework asks for evidence. Homework submitted **without a proper PR description** and the expected visual documentation **will be rejected**. Treat the PR body as the primary submission narrative—link to `README.md` / `HOWTORUN.md` in the repo, but the PR itself must still stand on its own.

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub. *Do not create pull requests into original repository*
2. Click **"Compare & pull request"** or go to **Pull requests** → **New pull request**
3. Set the base repository to the **your personal repository**
4. Set the base branch to `main`
5. Set the compare branch to your `homework-X-submission` branch
6. Fill in the PR template with a **thorough** write-up, including:
   - ✅ Summary of what you implemented (enough detail for someone unfamiliar with your branch)
   - 🛠️ AI tools used (prompts, workflow, what you verified yourself)
   - ⚠️ Challenges encountered and how you addressed them
   - 📸 **Screenshots** showing the running solution and, where required, AI-assisted work—embed key images in the PR.  Also add them to `docs/screenshots/`

📌 Home Work without detailed description and screenshots in PR will not be accepted. 

### 3️⃣ Assign the Instructor for Review

1. In the Pull Request, click **"Reviewers"** on the right sidebar
2. Search for and add the instructor's GitHub username Alexey-Popov
3. Optionally add labels like `homework-1`, `ready-for-review`

## 📋 Submission Requirements

Each homework submission **MUST** include a merge-ready **pull request** on your fork that matches the expectations under **Create a Pull Request** (detailed description, how to verify, and screenshots or demos as required). **Insufficient PR descriptions are grounds for rejection**, even if the code is present in the branch.

Each homework submission **MUST** also include in the repository:

### 📝 Required Documentation

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `README.md` | Clear explanation of your solution, approach, and AI tools used and *author* |
| `HOWTORUN.md` | Step-by-step guide to run your application |

### 📸 Screenshots *(Highly Expected)*

Include screenshots demonstrating:
- 🤖 AI tool interactions (prompts and responses)
- ✅ Your application running successfully
- 🧪 Test results (if applicable)
- 💡 Any interesting AI suggestions or corrections

> 📁 Place screenshots in the `docs/screenshots/` folder within each homework directory.

> 🎬 Provide runnable demo scripts where applicable.
